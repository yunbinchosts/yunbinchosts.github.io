Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Yunbin Cho, and I am a master's student in the [Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies](https://www.iii.u-tokyo.ac.jp/) at the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I am a member of [Prof. Hiromi M. Yokoyama’s laboratory](https://member.ipmu.jp/hiromi.yokoyama/en/index.html).

My major is **Science & Technology Studies (STS)**. I am interested in using quantitative methods to reflect the voices of the public—particularly **East Asian citizens**—in science and technology. Currently, I am researching public opinion and engagement with **Sustainable AI**, mainly in Japan. More broadly, I am exploring the relationship between the society and topics such as **AI (ethics)**, **nuclear energy**, and **geoengineering**.

I spent two years of my early education in [Chile](https://www.academiahumanidades.cl/), and I am now in Japan. Also, I grew up in a family of manga artists and have experience working as a manga assistant. I aim to continue conducting research that integrates diverse perspectives through collaboration across disciplines, cultures, and communities.
