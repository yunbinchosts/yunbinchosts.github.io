The development of AI is accelerating public discourse on nuclear energy. Japan, having overcome the Fukushima Daiichi Accident, has also set a policy direction to maximize the use of nuclear power in its 7th Strategic Energy Plan.

This project, to be conducted during the second year of my master’s program in 2025, will explore Japanese citizens’ views on the intersection of AI adoption and nuclear energy.Through a carefully designed survey, I aim to listen to public opinions on AI, climate change, energy security, and nuclear energy with caution and humility.
