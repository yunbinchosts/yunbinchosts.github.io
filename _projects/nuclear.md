The development of AI is accelerating public discourse on nuclear energy. Japan, having overcome the Fukushima Daiichi Accident, has also set a policy direction to maximize the use of nuclear power in its [Seventh Strategic Energy Plan](https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2025/0218_001.html).

This project, to be conducted during the second year of my master’s program in 2025, will investigate Japanese citizens’ views on the intersection of AI adoption and nuclear energy. I am particularly interested in the generational gap in attitudes: **older generations in Japan tend to be more supportive of environmentalism and energy policy overall, yet remain more opposed to nuclear energy** ([Kato-Nitta, 2021](https://researchmap.jp/naokokn/published_papers/36771841); [Kitada, 2024](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/taesj/23/1/23_J23.004/_html/-char/ja)). This pattern is both distinctive and underexplored. 

Through a carefully designed survey, I aim to capture public opinions on AI, climate change, energy security, and nuclear energy.
