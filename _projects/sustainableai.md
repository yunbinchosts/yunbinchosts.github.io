AI brings innovation and transformative potential to our society; yet, it simultaneously poses significant threats to sustainability through its intensive consumption of energy and resources, as well as the potential for biased outcomes. The concept of **"Sustainable"** AI by [Van Wynsberghe (2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00043-6#ref-CR17) addresses this dual aspects, aligning AI development with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Situated at the intersection of global challenges such as AI and sustainability, Sustainable AI necessitates democratic decision-making grounded in meaningful citizen participation. However, research on public regarding Sustainable AI remains sparse. Moreover, existing discussions on Sustainable AI, AI ethics, and public engagement in science and technology are largely concentrated in affluent Western contexts. This regional imbalance raises concerns that the distinct socio-cultural contexts and participatory practices of East Asia—particularly Japan—are underrepresented in current debates.

In response to this gap, my master's and doctoral research project seeks to explore the following questions, with a specific focus on Japan as a key case:

#### 1. What **opinion** do East Asian public hold regarding the challenges surrounding the research, development, and governance of Sustainable AI?
#### 2. How can public in East Asia meaningfully **engage** in addressing these challenges?

AI may open up new pathways for civic engagement in the pursuit of sustainability. With care and sincerity, I seek to take one step at a time toward realizing such possibilities within East Asian societies.
