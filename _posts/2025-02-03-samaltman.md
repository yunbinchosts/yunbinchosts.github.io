On Monday, February 3, 2025, I attended Dialogue at [UTokyo GlobE #14](https://globe.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/news/news_250203.html) as one of the 36 selected students across disciplines to engage in a conversation with Mr. Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Mr. Kevin Weil (CPO).

During the session, Mr. Altman asked us, "What do you want us to build?". In response, I shared my view that AI should not be perfect‚ÄîWe should AI‚Äôs emotional consequences; what kind of AI makes us happy, what should we teach AI, and most of all, how can we preserve our humanity. Mr. Altman‚Äôs response was simple but meaningful: ‚ÄúWe will work on it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs time to focus not just on the outcomes of AI, but on the process of evolving with AI.
I hope AI contributes to the evolution of a more human-centered societyüññ
