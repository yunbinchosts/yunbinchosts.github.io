I communicated the technical and ethical aspects of AI to a manga artist such as RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback). 

This led to the creation of a unique short story: in the manga, an AI developer falls in love with a woman named "Ai". When he tells the AI about her, the system mistakenly interprets Ai not as a person’s name, but as the Japanese word for "love" (愛/ai).
Taking it literally, the AI begins to spread the love everywhere.

This short manga was awarded the Special Jury Prize (実行委員会特別賞) in the General Category at the [26th Edition (2023) Niigata Manga Competition](https://manganime-niigata.jp/results/5069/). 

The artist continues to pursue challenges in manga. If you're interested in reading the full manga, or contact with the artist, feel free to contact me via email. Also, I welcome all forms of collaboration for science communication research, or AI ethics for comic artists!
